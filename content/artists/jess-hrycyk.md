description = "\"Illustrator and artist, Jess Hrycyk, cloisters herself in the verdant forests of myth, fantasy, and folklore. Drawing upon the rich soils of old world ornamentation, engraving and medieval calligraphy, she exhumes an ancient aesthetic to give new life and meaning to her explorations of nature, as well as her understanding of undying, existential themes. \""
