description = "What we are all about   Le Dép was an idea brought to life by a small Montreal, QC based designer -  hear!hear! design. With a love for all things design, this passion project was brought to life in hopes to share something neat and quirky with all of you.  Why Le Dép?  A \"dépanneur\" is a store that has all the necessary essentials. Le Dép is meant to represent the same idea stocked with fun creative essentials geared towards expressing one's own self or for the simple fun of it. You'll always find our shelves stocked with original pins, prints, patches and other creative-like provisions!"
