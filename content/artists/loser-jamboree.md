description = "After spending the better part of a decade in the punk rock scene, booking shows, touring the world, and being the designated «Merch Guy», Dédé wanted to put his ideas towards something great of his own. With the help of his long-time friend and collaborator, Edith Boucher, Broke & Stoked was born. With a profound love for coffee, pizza & beer, B&S celebrates the joys and consequences of living a worry-free life. \nConstantly building on their success, B&S now counts on the creativity of many artists. They are later joined by Death By Coffee & Good Chill and together, they have created Loser Jamboree: an art collective of brand owners, drinking enthusiasts, party planners, musicians and all-around positive people who enjoy good vibes and great times. Focusing on a strong sense of community, they also host the Montreal Punk Rock Flea Market, a biannual event giving the spotlight to smaller artists/brands to showcase their work to a greater audience."
