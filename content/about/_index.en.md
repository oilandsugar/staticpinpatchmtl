## Our mission is to promote artists and illustrators creating enamel pins and patches while bringing together fans of this vibrant, creative community.

Enamel pins are currently having a revival,
with new designs popping up on Instagram
almost every day. Their small size, accessible
price and ability to represent almost
anything have made them into a popular
fashion accessory and collectible. At Pin
Patch Mtl, we strive to showcase the
endless creativity of artists and illustrators
working with pins and patches.

Mani√®re Noire is a Montreal-based brand
designing obscure accessories (mostly
enamel pins) and selling them online to an
international audience.

We organized the first Pin Patch Mtl fair in
2017 to share our love of pins and patches
and contribute to the local community.
