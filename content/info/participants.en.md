## Your Table

* **Pins and patches need to be in the spotlight.** If you'd like some inspiration on how to put them well, you can check out the previous editions [here](https://www.facebook.com/pg/pinpatchmtl/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1859504404379076) and [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=152D07kkYE9Yt6koKcjMH7sDB1pCxVtCC) or look at [this inspiration folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vNId0-vskRkUlqIJTUpTBmDPAEjKr6-d).
* **You can bring something other than pins and patches!** We want an emphasis on  manufactured/made in series versus crafted (unique hand made items), but all products are welcomed.
* **Bring a tablecloth.** We provide tables but they aren't very pretty, so take that in consideration!
* For anyone that has a **wall space**, you can use push pins, tape or small nails. We will have some to share with you.

## Publicity

**Let’s advertise your presence at the even! Il faut faire de la publicité pour l'événement!** Invite all your friends to the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/596660647518312/), share it on your page and your instagram, make an announcement on your website, etc. This part is really important! We also have a small [press kit](https://drive.google.com/open?id=115zCAZv-7cWTbR7-A2UWM4twfR22vWHK) with images you can use, but you can make you own (as long as you use the official logo).

## Contest and gift bags

**The items for the gift bags should ideally be mailed to us before the event.** If it’s a problem for you, just contact us to let us know! We need up to 25 items (or more), but a few will be okay.  
Ex: stickers, postcards, small prints, pins, patches, coupons, etc. Note that **the maximum size for the items is 7” x 4.75”**.

We are also organizing **a contest** for which we would need a pin and/or a patch from you. It’s voluntary but all contributions are really appreciated! Please send them at the same time as the gift items, but identify them clearly.

**Address :**  
Geneviève L Reid  
107, 3e avenue, Verdun  
Qc, Canada  
H4G 2X1

**On the day of the event:** One person will go around to pick up the items for the gift bags and another one for the contest items. Your items need to be ready not long after your arrival, so don't put them too far in your stock!

## Lunch [FoodRelay](https://foodrelay.ca/)

If you’d like to receive a personalized lunch cooked in the morning by a chef and delivered to your table for 15$ per person, please contact us! You will be offered many options (adapted to all sorts of diets, allergies, and restrictions). Since there aren’t many restaurants near the venue, it’s a good idea!
