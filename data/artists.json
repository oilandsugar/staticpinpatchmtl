    "description": " After spending the better part of a decade in the punk rock scene, booking shows, touring the world, and being the designated «Merch Guy», Dédé wanted to put his ideas towards something great of his own. With the help of his long-time friend and collaborator, Edith Boucher, Broke & Stoked was born. Having strong ties to the punk rock community, and driving inspiration from all of its aspects, the brand was quickly a hit amongst friends and acquaintances. Thanks to the huge reach of the music scene and social media, Broke & Stoked quickly gained a loyal fanbase across the world. With a profound love for coffee, pizza & beer, B&S celebrates the joys and consequences of living a worry-free life. Our ideals are shared through dark humour and artful designs which are now the trademark of our brand. True to the DIY ethic from our punk roots, we’ve taken the brand on the road for countless events & festivals across Canada, the US, and Europe, multiplying collaborations and making new friends along the way. Constantly building on our success, B&S now counts on the creativity of many artists. Two of them also running their own brands Death By Coffee & Good Chill. Together, we’ve created Loser Jamboree: an art collective of brand owners, drinking enthusiasts, party planners, musicians and all-around positive people who enjoy good vibes and great times. Under the LJ banner, we’ve joined forces for the production & distribution of all our goods. Focusing on a strong sense of community, we’re also hosts of the Montreal Punk Rock Flea Market, a biannual event giving the spotlight to smaller artists/brands to showcase their work to a greater audience while chugging beers & having fun; which is the only question driving any of our decisions: IS THIS GOING TO BE FUN?"
